# Requirements ðŸ”§

In order to use this guide they will need to use a console and install the following software:

## 1) GIT.

### Linux/BSD/Mac:
Use your favorite package manager (APT for Debian):
```shell
rafa@debian:~/home/proyect$ apt-get install git 
git version 2.20.1
```

Verify that it was successfully installed with this command:
```shell
rafa@debian:~/home/proyect$ git --version 
git version 2.20.1
```

### Windows:
Download the installer from [**GIT for Windows.**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## 2) Text editor or IDE: 

I suggest one of the following: 
* [**VI/VIM.**](https://www.vim.org/download.php)
* [**VS Code.**](https://vscodium.com/#install)
* [**Geany.**](https://www.geany.org/download/releases/)
